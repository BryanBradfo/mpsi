# Preparatory Class - First Year 🇫🇷📚

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of mathematical assignments, exercises, and projects completed during my **first year of preparatory classes (Classe Préparatoire aux Grandes Écoles - CPGE)** for top French engineering schools.

Throughout the year, I explored a variety of mathematical concepts using both analytical reasoning and computational tools like **LaTeX**, **Python**, and **MySQL**. This folder showcases my handwritten mathematical work typeset with LaTeX, including differential calculus, linear algebra, and integrals.

## 🧮 Content

Each file in this repository corresponds to a specific exercise or problem set, and is written entirely in LaTeX. Below is a brief overview of what you'll find:

- **TD29_Exo16.tex**  
  Taylor expansion of $(1+h)^{1/h}$ around 0 using logarithmic manipulation and exponentiation rules.

- **TD29_Exo30.tex**  
  Investigation of the kernel of successive powers of an endomorphism, as well as a humorous geometrical aside with trigonometrical identities.

- **TD29_Exo31.tex**  
  Integration of exponential expressions via logarithmic and substitution methods.

- **TD31_Exo36.tex**  
  A formal demonstration that $\text{Ker}(f^0) \subset \text{Ker}(f^1) \subset \text{Ker}(f^2) \subset \text{Ker}(f^3)$ using functional composition.

- **TD31_Exo39.tex**  
  Proof of the equivalence between $\text{Im}(f) = \text{Im}(f^2)$ and $\text{Im}(f) = \text{Im}(f^3)$ through rigorous inclusion reasoning.

- **TD33_Exo10.tex**  
  Advanced integral calculus involving trigonometric functions and rational substitutions. Includes multiple techniques: substitution, decomposition into partial fractions, symmetry properties, and arctangent identities.

## ✍️ Tools & Skills Used

- **LaTeX**: All documents are typeset using LaTeX with packages such as `amsmath`, `tikz`, `fancybox`, and `fourier` for clarity and professional formatting.
- **Mathematical Rigor**: Exercises feature detailed reasoning and derivations.
- **Pedagogical Flair**: Explanations include side notes, humorous asides, and intuitive tricks — all part of the prep school culture!

## 📁 Structure

Each file is self-contained and named according to the worksheet (`TDxx`) and the exercise number (`ExoXX`).

## 💡 Fun Fact

One of these exercises humorously thanks a "Duc" for teaching LaTeX — a testament to the collaborative, sometimes chaotic, and always enriching environment of preparatory classes in France.
